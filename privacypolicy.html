          <p class="privacy__bold">American Wisdom Gold, respects your privacy and does not sell your personal information.</p>
          <p>If you are receiving this Privacy Policy, it is because you are applying to become a customer. This Privacy Policy explains how Oxford Gold Group, Inc. (hereafter, “Oxford,” “we,” or “us”) we treat the personal information that you provide to us in either applying to become a customer or as a customer. It also explains your privacy rights and how you can exercise them.</p>
          <p>We follow this privacy policy in accordance with applicable law of the United States and those of its states in which we operate. We do not operate in countries other than the United States, nor do we knowingly offer or provide our services to residents of countries other than the United States.</p>
          <p>This privacy policy applies only to our collection of information; it does not apply to information that you may provide to or is collected by a third-party. Indeed, in certain instances, we are obtaining information from you on behalf of a third-party, such as a precious metal custodian. While our collection and use of such information is governed by this policy, the collection and use of information by the other third-party is subject to their privacy practices and policies, including any privacy rights that the third party may offer.</p>
          <p>This privacy policy does not apply to our collection of information from you through our website or over the phone if you are not an applicant or customer. Information collected from you in those capacities are governed by the privacy policy available on our website at <a href="www.americanwisdomgold.com">www.americanwisdomgold.com/privacypolicy/</a></p>
          <p class="privacy__bold">American Wisdom Gold, respects your privacy and does not sell your personal information.</p>
          <p>We collect personal information from you during the application process and while you are a customer for the purposes of providing our services to you, to manage our relationship with you, and for legal and regulatory purposes. You will voluntarily provide most of the information directly to us. The specific information we collect and how we use that information are discussed in detail below.</p>
          <p class="privacy__bold">How We Store And Protect Your Personal Information</p>
          <p>The security and confidentiality of your information are important to us. In general, we keep your personal information for the duration of your relationship with us. Once you terminate your relationship with us, we generally will continue to store archived copies of your personal information for legitimate business purposes and to comply with the law.</p>
          <p>Your information will remain subject to the terms of this Policy even if we undergo a business transition. We may transfer your information to a successor person or entity upon an acquisition or other corporate reorganization. You hereby consent to such transfers, and we may assign and transfer all of the rights, benefits, duties, and obligations of this Policy.</p>
          <p>We do not store your personal information on our own servers but, instead, use third parties, who take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard and deter unauthorized access to your information. In this regard, access to this information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access. Please know that no platform, application, website, electronic database or other format or system is completely secure. Moreover, no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure nor can any be guaranteed to be totally secure, and, for this reason, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that safeguards employed will prevent the disclosure of your information.</p>
          <p>If you become aware of a security breach, please notify us immediately at info@oxfordgoldgroup.com, or call us at (833) 600-4653.</p>

Precious metals, like all investments, carry risk. Gold, silver and platinum coins and bars may appreciate, depreciate or stay the same depending on a variety of factors. The Oxford Gold Group cannot guarantee and makes no representation, that any metals purchased will appreciate at all or appreciate sufficiently to make customers a profit. The decision to purchase or sell precious metals, and which precious metals to purchase or sell, are the customer's decision alone, and purchases and sales should be made subject to the customer's own research, prudence, and judgment.
